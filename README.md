# Bank-Account-Java-Application
// Create a new class for a bank account 
// Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number. 
//  
// Create getters and setters for each field 
// Create two additional methods
//  1. To allow the customer to deposit funds ( this should increment the balance field). 
//  2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balnace field. 
// But not allow the withdrawal to complete if their are insufficient funds. 
// You will want to create various code in the Main class to confirm your code is Working.
// Add some System.outprintln's in the two methods above as well.
